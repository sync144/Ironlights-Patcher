# Ironlights-Patcher
A simple patching program for Ironlights modding. Made using Python and the tkinter library, along with the Uber APK Signer by patrickfav

# Usage
For this software to work correctly, it requires a copy of the Ironlights sharedasset1 file to be put into the same directory as itself, preferrably a sharedasset1 file with the modded tag.
